# World of Warcraft Fishing Bot

A simple fishing bot made it python. It uses the audio output of World of Warcraft to auto-fish. Only works for Windows.

## Getting Started

1. You will need to have Stereo Mix input device in your computer enabled. If you don't see Stereo Mix in your input devices try to update drivers and make sure you have some sort of output device connected to your computer.

2. Make sure that the ouput device for World of Warcraft is the same output device which the Stereo Mix is listening to.

3. Install addon called Better Fishing.

4. Make sure that the addon's keybind to cast is set to F6.

5. Turn off every sound type except "Sound Effects". And set your sound volume to following:
    - Master Volume 5%
    - Music 0%
    - Effects 100%
    - Ambience 0%
    - Dialog 0%

6. Go to a silent place.

7. Now just run the python script and let the bot do the work. It is recommended to don't do anything else on the computer while the bot is fishing, because you can interfere with the sound output!
